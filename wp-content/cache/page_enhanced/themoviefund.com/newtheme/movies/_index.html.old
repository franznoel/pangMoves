The Ark has enormous supernatural power and he now has evidence of its extraterrestrial ancestry. It is the only object that can help mankind against the imminent threat of extinction the World suddenly now faces.</p>
<p>Sinclair’s chase for this secret, ancient knowledge will take us around the World following both the trail of the Ark through history and the sites once used as space ports and homes of the Ancient Alien invaders, the Annunaki. As he travels we intercut and see, in spectacular glory, the history of &#8220;Islandia&#8221; the Annunaki&#8217;s home Planet and their domination of Earth, when the Annunaki or &#8220;GODS&#8221; once ruled. We’ll travel to places as diverse as Iraq, Peru and South Africa. Sinclair quickly learns that, to have any hope of saving our species, we need to understand what began on Earth 250,000 years ago. He starts to understand that what began so long ago, continues, to this day, behind the scenes in every corridor and office of power and influence.</p>
<p>We need to understand that everything Sinclair suspected is true. The Annunaki are coming back and much, much sooner than anyone would think. Which means accepting some difficult truths, truths such as: life is not at all as we know it; we are not who we think we are and everything you ever thought you knew is a lie.</p>
<p>PLANET X &#8211; 250,000 YEARS AGO</p>
<p>QUEEN LUSKET – FIRST LADY<br />
Daughter of a noble, well respected, highly decorated and thoroughly brutal, ill-tempered Alien Warlord. His violence runs through her blood. Lusket is a Treaty Wife. A Noble in her home land, she is humanoid and would be seen as a great beauty across many humanoid species including those from Planet X. Her planet sent a fleet to attack Planet X, the fleet was repelled but the war continued over many years. As a Treaty Wife she becomes Royalty and allowed Elixir.<br />
The peace brought by Anu leaves her very frustrated, isolated and bored. To alleviate her frustrations she has multiple affairs, including with Senior Heads of Anu&#8217;s Military. The danger excited her, as did the prospect of being involved with Military decisions. She hoped to manoeuvre hostilities. This backfired when the Commander, in fear of discovery and a death sentence, had her banished from from all Military bases, actions and decisions. This, in turn, tipped her into increasing dangerous and potentially damaging affairs. She pursues brutally sexual relationships with Palace Hybrids, humanoids and beasts engineered into mythological creatures to serve as Palace Guards.<br />
The Hybrids are bred with a violent passion, Lusket takes full advantage of the healing properties of the Elixir to allow her encounters to be frenzied and violent. She still relies on genetically engineered loyalty and restraint or the beasts would rip her apart. She takes great pleasure in high risk adventures with courtiers, servants and entertainers. The higher the risk of discovery the more she takes pleasure. Most dangerously of all, she incestuously pursued and ensnared Cassius. Her and Anu&#8217;s eldest son, Cassius&#8217; inherited propensity to sadism is well served by Lusket&#8217;s lust for extremes.<br />
In public, Anu and Lusket present a united front. Behind closed doors there are schemes, divisions, jealousy (on both sides, Anu is increasingly besotted with Lillith) and a fury that will soon come to a head.</p>

      <div class="scrollbars excrt-cont re-254"><p>&#8220;A man who cant dream invents a machine which enables him to walkup in his lucid dreams where he becomes an unlikely action hero.&#8221;</p>
<p>SLEEP WAKE DREAM is an action/comedy about a man with a rare condition &#8212; he can’t dream.  One day he finds a way to overcome this condition, opening a whole new world for him.</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS<br />
JOEL BELLOWS can’t dream. He suffers from Charcot-Wilbrand Syndrome or low dream recall. Joel is a kindly, family man feeling the affects of middle age, who volunteers his time to help elderly hospice patients and troubled youths. Something is missing in his life. His wife nags him and his teenage kids don’t respect him and he can only take the abuse. Joel doesn’t really know who he is or what he is supposed to be doing with his life. Joel is seeking answers. One day he purchases a Chinese salt lamp that assures, “peaceful sleep with vivid dreams”. At first it appears to have no affect. But then it opens a whole new world for Joel &#8212; his dream world, where the once reserved, kind-hearted, nebbish family man, becomes the bad ass killer who can do anything he wants, consequence free, because this is a fantasy world of his own creation and isn’t real…or is it?<br />
In his dreams, Joel begins seeing Chinese symbols which he finds out are prophesies from the I Ching which come true in his waking life. These prophesies become more and more dangerous as Joel becomes involved with one of his students, ANNA, a young woman married to an influential corporate CEO, MR. GLASS, whom Anna has had a falling out. Joel becomes her protector as Mr. Glass wants to silence Anna for knowing too much about a secret classified government project his company is involved in.<br />
Quickly the dream world crosses over into reality and it becomes impossible for Joel to tell the difference between truth and pure fantasy. SLEEP WAKE DREAM is one man’s darkly comedic search for meaning, identity and freedom, which he comes to realize, can only be found in his dreams.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS<br />
After two decades in prison, old mobster, NICO &#8220;CHICKIE&#8221; CICCOLINI, is finally a free man. But not for long. His old Mafia pal, BOBBY &#8220;RAGS&#8221; RAGANO, picks Chickie up at prison. Not in a black Caddy, but in a Prius. Rags takes Chickie to see his daughter, GABRIELLA, who breaks the bad news. Gabriella is putting Chickie into a nursing home, which, in Chickie&#8217;s mind, is worse than getting tossed back into the can. The nursing home, called &#8220;The Villas,&#8221; is a pretty nice place, but that doesn&#8217;t matter to Chickie. He decides to bust out and nearly escapes when he bumps into an old &#8220;business associate&#8221; – JOSEPH &#8220;NOSTRILS&#8221; MAZZONE, a Villas resident. Nostrils tells Chickie how the Villas needs to &#8220;get organized&#8221; – how, at the Villas, he could “get respect” like the old days, make money and score with the ladies. Intrigued, Chickie changes his mind and moves into his Villas pad, which he spruces up with one-armed bandits and pictures of the Blessed Mother. Chickie and Nostrils quickly hook up with PHIL &#8220;MUSSELS&#8221; MARINARA, another old mobster who cruises around The Villas in a Rascal. Chickie encounters friction from Villas Director, BONNIE BURNS, the perky enforcer of all nursing-home rules. Chickie keeps dodging Bonnie while turning the Villas into a geriatric version of the old neighborhood. All along, something has been eating at Chickie. His son, MICHAEL, wants nothing to do with him. Michael is a legitimate guy who runs what appears to be a legitimate bagel shop in Manhattan. Chickie heads to the bagel shop to confront Michael when bullet fire tears up the shop. Chickie gets shot – in the ass – and has to spend a night in the hospital. It’s there when he learns the bagel shop is a front business for a young, ruthless Mafioso named DANTE MANGIANI. Meanwhile, back at the Villas, Chickie has officially become the Godfather. Money rolls in with the Viagra sales; Wii bowling matches get fixed; Villas security guards get paid off with scratch-off lottery tickets; Chickie and Nostrils get hired to whack a raccoon; and even Bonnie calls on Chickie for some muscle, to intimidate the punk who&#8217;s been bullying her son. Then, one day, Dante&#8217;s goons show up at the Villas, demanding a piece of Chickie’s nursing-home action. Chickie tells them to go screw themselves, and that’s when Dante believes Michael is funneling his money into Chickie&#8217;s nursing-home rackets. A big battle erupts at the Villas during the shuffleboard tournament no less. Included in the battle are Dante’s goons, the FBI, a helicopter, and Chickie and his &#8220;old fellas.&#8221; Chickie, with the help of the Feds and Bonnie, saves Michael from Dante. And, as Dante gets hauled away by law enforcement, Chickie and Michael embrace for the first time in many years. Now, it’s time to celebrate with &#8220;the old fellas&#8221; at a local restaurant. And what restaurant would that be? The Olive Garden… of course.</p>

      <div class="scrollbars excrt-cont re-260"><p>&#8220;A award worthy musical about the birth of the Movie Industry from 1910 to present day&#8221;.</p>
<p>Paramount Pictures: The Famous Player’s Club is an epic biopic charting the history of one of Hollywood’s<br />
most influential film studio. From the studios birth in 1910 with Hungarian-born Adolph Zukor, stepping off<br />
the immigration boat in New York with just a suitcase and a dream to their position as one of the most<br />
powerful cutting edge forces in global cinema. This is the ultimate tale of the American Dream and the<br />
history of American Cinema.</p>
<p>Boasting a unique narrative structure, the film centers on the people that played a key role in the<br />
Paramount Pictures story. Here are a selection of the possible voice-overs and narrators as our story<br />
unfolds:<br />
1910 – 1923 Adolf Zukor, Founder<br />
1924 – 1927 Douglas Fairbanks, Actor<br />
1928 – 1931 Jeanette MacDonald, Musical actress<br />
1932 – 1934 Mae West, Actress<br />
1935 – 1944 Adolf Zukor, Founder<br />
1945 – 1948 The judge (from People vs. paramount hearing)<br />
1949 – 1951 News reporter (from rise of the Studio news TV Report)<br />
1952 – 1954 Bob Hope, Actor<br />
1953 – 1956 GOD (Powerful god-like narration as heard in 1956’s ‘The Ten Commandments’.<br />
1957 – 1959 Star Trek TV’s Captain Kirk<br />
1960 – 1963 Elvis (on set of ‘Fun in Acapulco’)<br />
1964– 1969 John Wayne (on set of ‘True Grit’)<br />
1970– 1973 The Godfather (Marlon Brando sound-alike)<br />
1974– 1979 Jack Nicolson behind the scene in ‘Chinatown’<br />
1980– 1986 Don Simpson (sound-alike)<br />
1987– 1990 Eddie Murphy (‘Trading Places’)<br />
1991– 1994 Forrest Gump<br />
1995– 1999 Steven Spielberg (DreamWorks meeting)<br />
2000– 2008 Brad Grey, Paramount CEO<br />
2009– 2011 Brad Pitt, Actor<br />
2012 – future Joe Public<br />
Each represents a different period in the company’s history and when put together they act as one coherent<br />
storyteller. The Film will use Paramount’s movies to reference benchmarks in film making history from<br />
1910 – 1920s Silent Films (‘Cinderella’,’ Carmen’, ‘Davy Crockett’, ‘Snow White’) to the comedies &amp; musicals<br />
of the mid 1930s (Mississippi (1935), Pennies From Heaven (1936) and Sing You Sinners (1938) featuring<br />
their first academy nominations (For Whom the Bell Tolls) to early Panavision Technicolor pictures of the<br />
1950s (‘The Ten Commandments’, ‘Peter Pan’) to the rise of the early Movie Stars (such as Cary Grant,<br />
Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis and Marlon Brando). The film then focuses on the<br />
first studio director deals with the first blockbusters from Steven Spielberg’s ‘Jaws’ and Francis Ford<br />
Coppola’s ‘The Godfather’ of the 60s and 70s.</p>
<p>We then see the creation of film franchises (‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’, ‘Friday the 13th’, ‘Aeroplane’) and<br />
onto1980s classics (‘Staying Alive’, ‘Grease’) to a dawn of new film genres (‘Paranormal Activity’,<br />
‘Cloverfield’, ‘Shrek’) and finally closing with big budget modern day 3D Blockbusters (‘Transformers’, ‘Iron<br />
Man’, ‘Thor’, ‘Super 8’, ‘Tintin’). Each episode in time will reflect a stage in film making history recognized<br />
with movie star cameos from the era in never scene before out-takes, deleted scenes and interviews from<br />
each of the movies it references throughout the studio’s history.</p>

      <div class="scrollbars excrt-cont re-967"><p>This first part of the trilogy will open Hollywood’s eyes to a whole new meaning of “zombie film” with a twist never done before on the big screen. THE CROWD is the story of a host who unknowingly brings an unstoppable epidemic into the United States turning the majority of the country’s people into zombies through the act of a terrorist’s syringe in an airport. Set apart by stages for the first seven days the “newly dead” can blend into everyday life while using contemplative, premeditated malicious intent to make their following bigger before their seven days are up before losing intelligence into a stage 2 zombie. Six months later after the country has transformed into an apocalyptic zombie frenzy, seven survivors try to team together for survival through the guidance of their leader, Aidan. But there is one big fear lurking behind them, hot on their trail, with a seven day race against time. A “newly dead” wife of one of the group’s members, with her military background is hell bent on revenge. Think-“THE EXORCIST” with a MACHINE GUN. How can you tell who has a pulse while your group is under constant pressure? Who can you trust with your supplies? Your gun? What does it mean to be alive? How far would you go to stay alive? What does it mean….TO BE DEAD? and knowing it. WOW.<br />

<div class="fild-st">THE TEAM It is absolutely crucial to have first-rate people involved in the company. Professionals who can interact creatively, bouncing ideas and concepts off each other, and then develop superior products. 6 KIM WINTHER, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER Kim is presently shooting in London as Co Producer/1st Assistant Director of Tom Cruise's new Movie: “ALL YOU NEED IS KILL” It's important to note that Kim also held similar positions on the movie "Zombieland".  Lars Winther is famous for his ability as Assistant Director/Producer, excellent addition to our very capable team. Peter Winther is a Director/Producer with a wide variety of experience in both big and small budget feature films and television.  He is perfectly suited to direct this movie considering he is “the black sheep of the family” If he was cast in a movie his character would likely be evil. He has charm and personality and if he was a used car salesman all the cars would be sold in an hour and then break down as they left the lot.  They have a license plate in Los Angeles that reads “If you know Peter Winther honk your horn. Nobody did. He turned everyone into Zombies, Peter wrote and directed the supernatural thriller SPEED DEMON based on the final creation by legendary creature designer Stan Winston.  Peter also wrote and will produce/direct along with Oscar winning Director/Producer Nikita Mikhalkov (BURNT BY THE SUN) the story of the renowned Russian hockey star Valery Kharlomav who many consider to be the greatest hockey player ever but died under mysterious circumstances. KHARLOMAV is a Russian/Canadian co-production.  Peter is also attached to direct the sci-fi action feature film, THE ISOBAR RUN, for ELECTRIC ENTERTAINMENT. Winther recently directed episodes for LEVERAGE, a TV series for TNT currently beginning its fourth season. Anan Bay, Let us start with me I am known as AJ, easy to remember, and I am the unlikely leader with the least impressive resume. However, make no mistake I am a very impressive person because I know how to get things done. People talk and dream about making motion picture magic. I don’t dream about it I just go and do it.  Yes this is a scary movie but I want to make it, will enjoy watching it and afterwards counting the money which will make me sleep just fine. I left my formidable acting career to become a Producer. Since 2006 I have worked on several blockbuster hits such as Fast & Furious, Shoot ‘Em Up, Hangover 2, Battle: Los Angeles and Frost/Nixon. Aside from motion pictures, I also worked on several TV shows such as MTV’s Parental Control, Spike TV’s Deadliest Warrior and Bullrun. </div>

<div class="orange">Investor Info</div>
<div class="fild-st">PROFIT PROPOSAL After the distribution company recoups their marketing expenses the investor will get his money back first followed by a 25-30% distribution fee. What’s left is the NET. 50% of that amount is the investor’s profit. The other 50% goes to the Producers/Director and likely some Actors. Infinite Bay Production is also prepared to offer our investors 5% in perpetuity, which includes all revenues from all sources during the life of the movie. Investing in the entertainment business is considered aggressive and is not for the weak of heart; however, the financial rewards can be spectacular. That said, the Producers intend to take all necessary steps in creating a financially successful picture. As a potential investor, we know you will find it comforting that this picture is a very commercial concept with theatrical appeal.</div>

	  <p>In a world where the Darkstalkers have risen up against humanity, a war wages be<span class="remore" data-mode="hide" data-id="re-969">read more...</span> </p>
      <div class="scrollbars excrt-cont re-969"><p>In a world where the Darkstalkers have risen up against humanity, a war wages between the demons who want to turn the world to darkness and those that will do anything to stop them.  With the humans desperately trying to survive and defend themselves against the Darkstalkers and other warring human factions, only those who dare to challenge the Darkstalkers have a chance of saving humanity.<br />
The Darkstalkers are made up of demons, vampires, catpeople, werewolves, zombies and all kinds of paranormal creatures.  Many are halfbreeds – half-human/half-creature.   </p>
<p>The Worlds –<br />
Makai, the Demon World<br />
Earth, the Human World<br />
Majigen, the other dimension, the In-between World</p>
<p>Main Characters –<br />
King Belial Aensland – Very powerful demon, the king of the Darkstalkers. Although he is head of the demons, he is actually a fair and wise ruler. However, he shares in the attitude of superiority over humans and the desire to eliminate them.  </p>
<p>Demitri Maximoff – half human/half vampire who is a high ranking Darkstalker. He feeds on human blood &#038; souls. By draining blood, he turns humans into his servants. He had a conflict with King Belial Aensland and was banished to his castle in the human world, but over time has built his powers back up and wants to take over as king of the Makai. </p>
<p>TREATMENT</p>
<p>Act I<br />
The earth has been ravaged by demons.   King Belial Aensland rules Makai, the Demon World with his daughter, Morrigan at his side.  King Belial is the one responsible for leading the uprising against humans, in order to move beyond the Demon World and take over the Human World, as well.  Many humans have died and society as we know it, has collapsed.   Higher governments are gone and local Suzerains have taken over.   Humans spend their time scrounging for food and shelter, and trying to avoid demon attacks and the warring, greedy Suzerains.<br />
In the Demon World, the demons are also in conflict.  King Belial, while wanting to destroy humans, is actually a fair ruler of Makai.  However, there are those who are power-hungry and want to take over.  Dmitri Maximoff is strong demon who wants to rule.  He is constantly presenting conflict against King Belial and at the end of Act I, tries to make his move by challenging Morrigan.  As she is a succubus, Dmitri falls for her, and she is able to overpower him.   This is the first of what will be ongoing contention between them.<br />
Meanwhile, on Earth, Donovan Baine, a rogue demon who fights to save the humans, meets Anita.  She is an orphan with uncontrollable, strong psychic powers, who humans fear.   When we first see her, she and a number of other children are being pursued by demons.  Because of her abilities, she tries to destroy the demon, but also takes down a number of the children (she can’t control her power and has no remorse).  Donovan intervenes, killing the demon, and they meet.  He sees how callous she is, or rather, how callous she had become out of necessity.  She carries a small doll.  Donovan chops the head off of the doll.  Anita gets angry.  Donovan explains that this is a good thing.  It is the first show of emotion from Anita, the first sign of humanity.  She joins him.<br />
Back in Makai, Jedah Dohma is rising in power.  He recruits and collects followers.  He is not as obvious an aggressor as Dmitri, but that’s intentional.  He keeps a low profile and concentrates on his main goal – convincing the rest of the demons that Belial has not been successful and is the reason for the failure to take over the Human World.  The time for change is now and he (Jedah) should be in charge. </p>

<div class="orange">Tax Breaks</div>
<div class="fild-st">Louisiana offers a 30% transferable incentive for total in-state expenditures related to the production of a motion picture. An additional 5% labor incentive can be earned on the payroll of Louisiana residents that are employed by a state certified motion picture production. The incentives are fully transferable and Louisiana has no limit to the amount of incentives that can be earned by a single production. Only money spent on your production costs within the borders of the state of Louisiana will qualify for the 30% incentive. That includes all services that are performed in Louisiana from residents and non-residents alike.  In addition, many local communities offer additional percentage incentive.  For any location filming, we plan to shoot in towns like Lafayette, LA, in order to take advantage of an additional 2%, bringing the total potential incentive to 37%.  This incentive can guarantee over a third of the investment back to the investor, taken either as a tax credit after production, or if preferred, once monies are in place, we can sell back the incentive to the state of Louisiana at 85 cents on the dollar (or possibly more from private companies). Considering the Louisiana tax incentive, investors would have potentially up to 37% of their investment guaranteed before the films on the slate even hit theatres or other forms of distribution.  In this precarious financial climate, film production in the state of Louisiana offers more stability than many other parts of the country.  The state is very supportive of the tax incentive and of production, as a whole, happily growing what they refer to as “Hollywood South”.  Likewise, film is a safer investment than it has been in the past, as other areas have grown in risk.   As with all investments, there are always risks in investing in films, however, despite the rise and fall of the stock market and the recession, people are still going to the movies, ordering from Netflix and renting from Redbox (and other distribution channels).   </div>

<div class="orange">Investor Info</div>
<div class="fild-st">Summer 2011 saw huge numbers for big budget films.  TRANSFORMERS:  DARK OF THE MOON, grossed $1.12B worldwide theatrical.  The estimated budget was $195M.  The film was recently released on DVD and continues to make money.  CAPTAIN AMERICA cost $145M and has grossed $366M worldwide theatrical.  THOR, made for $150M, grossed nearly $450M worldwide theatrical.  The more modest RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, at a budget of $93M, has grossed $430M worldwide theatrical. When other forms of entertainment (theatre, travel, fine dining) become more expensive, movie audiences grow.  Likewise, even more revenue streams from DVD, online streaming and On-Demand continue to grow.  The small budgets of the films on the slate offer investors the chance to make a great deal of profit through all revenue streams. </div>

      <div class="scrollbars excrt-cont re-982"><p>My name is Jeremiah Sayys. I’m a writer/director/producer. I’m developing a new film titled<br />
“The Ruled Vassal” and I’m looking for funds to help with research and getting the script<br />
written.</p>
<p>Logline:<br />
An enigmatic young artist’s unalterable compulsion is threatened after entangling with a deeply<br />
tortured motivational speaker.</p>
<p>Premise:<br />
A parasite called an Ecumus, from a creature race that lives in another dimension, inhabits<br />
human babies from conception. The Ecumus is born as a human and interacts with its human<br />
counterpart as the Ecumus takes control, using its human counterpart to implicate feelings<br />
and emotions, all while the human is aware of everything that is going on. An Ecumus/Human<br />
hybrid is a vassal to what we know as the Bogeyman. They are the hunters as while Takers,<br />
a physical creature that roams and protects the dimension, are the gathers.  The Ecumus track<br />
down those who have done bad and evil things, be it children or adults, and implicate<br />
themselves into their victim’s lives to the point to where their victim trusts them, then they<br />
give them over to the Takers to be dragged into the dimension for them to suffer at the hands<br />
of the Bogeyman. The victims are kept in the “hall of pain” where they’re trapped within a<br />
living organic wall that preserves them, where they suffer excruciating pain until they are taken<br />
from the wall and are eaten. The Ecumus inhabits a host once a generation. Once it’s born it<br />
ages until its 20, then stops. But the Ecumus begins seeking out its victims at a very young age.<br />
The Ecumus only inhabits a female human, so when the Bogeyman comes out of hibernation<br />
once a generation to feed, he has a partner to then procreate with. The Bogeyman chooses,<br />
from the victims that have been collected, which victims he wants to eat and gives the rest to<br />
the Takers. After procreating with the Ecumus/Human hybrid, the Ecumus leaves the human<br />
body and gives it over to the Bogeyman to be eaten.</p>
<p>Evre, a young artist inhabited by the Ecumus, lives a normal life while pursuing the Ecumus’<br />
hobby. Once Evre meets Eben, a deeply tortured motivational speaker with a connection to<br />
her visceral world, everything changes. They slowly begin developing a relationship. The<br />
Ecumus begins to actually feel what the human counterpart feels and thinks rather than just<br />
implicating the feelings and thoughts. But after a disturbing incident where Evre discovers<br />
Eben is connected with her world, it prompts her to begin investigating him to find out who<br />
he truly is. As their relationship grows closer, Evre falls in love with him, in the process of<br />
discovering that Eben is the last descendant of Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
<p>Edgar Allen Poe was to first to have the ability to see into this world. Instead of it affecting<br />
him he went into the world and raised these creatures to have a purpose, which was to<br />
punish people who do bad and evil things. Whether it is was a child or an adult. Poe used<br />
his ability to his advantage to try to make our world a better place and taught these<br />
creatures to get rid of the evil and bad people, but eventually it got out of control and Poe<br />
abandoned them and disappeared without a trace. Poe’s future generations could not<br />
comprehend the fact that they could see into this world and it caused them to go crazy<br />
and/or disappear or commit suicide. However, Eben is just as strong as Edgar Allen Poe in<br />
comprehending the world, but does struggle at times to handle it.</p>
<p>Through her relationship with Eben, Evre’s human side and the Ecumus bond. It begins<br />
to care about Evre and comes to understand that people deserve a second chance to<br />
make up for their mistakes and be forgiven. As the Ecumus comes to care more and more<br />
for Evre’s human side, it puts them both in danger. The Ecumus learns the only way Evre<br />
can truly be safe and be with Eben, is to end her world. And to do that the Ecumus must<br />
die. She finds the way with the help of the Decider, an immortal being that lives between<br />
dimensions. After an emotional and brutal trip into her world, where Evre barely gets out<br />
alive, she’s able to get back to the Decider and kill the Ecumus inside of her, then unties<br />
with Eben.</p>

	  <p>Note from Producers:

Attached please find:-
 
1) Synposis of the book that <span class="remore" data-mode="hide" data-id="re-989">read more...</span> </p>
      <div class="scrollbars excrt-cont re-989"><p>Note from Producers:</p>
<p>Attached please find:-</p>
<p>1) Synposis of the book that Terry Winter used to cull the screenplay from, it is a very good indication at to the richness of the material, that someone can ascribe to without going through the book, verbatim.</p>
<p>2) Bullet Points forwarded to Darren Aronofsky (Noah, Black Swan, The Wrestler) as a potential director for the movie although at this point in time, Bonnie feels there are people more suited to the material. She prefers a director who will be able to stretch the dynamic of the character and take people deeper into the character&#8217;s psyche, along the lines lets say of what David O. Russell did with American Hustle and/or David Fincher with Social Network.</p>
<p>3) One of many reviews of the book that was released worldwide. </p>
<p>*Framed received critical acclaim when it was first published by Mainstream Publishing (London/Edinburgh) who also published &#8216;Catch Me If You Can&#8217; and &#8216;Braveheart&#8217;.  </p>
<p>All one has to do is go on line to see how widely spread the book has been with feature stories in The New York Times, London Observer, The Independent, The Guardian, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and had a shelf life of over ten years at Barnes &#038; Noble etc.</p>
<p>As far as credits and position, obviously if they were to co-finance or finance the film in its entirety along the lines of what &#8230; did with Wolf Of Wall Street, then they would receive Executive Producer credits as well as points (position) on the film.  To what degree we would have to discuss that part with our attorney &#8230;. &#8230; has been in the business for over 40 years and is considered a leading authority on independent film financing as he wrote the book literally (The Producers Guide To Independent Financing) that is a bible among film producers.</p>
<p>We would have to have CAA send the first draft of the screenplay which will undergo revisions once the director is on board which we assume will be the case in approx. 3-6 months. Bonnie as I mentioned earlier will also be pursuing a lead actor with an eye towards involving him in the production.</p>
<p>Terry Winter will also be a producer on the movie if he so desires. His contract with our company has that stipulation.</p>
<p>The book (rights) and screenplay are held by our company &#8230;. We hired Terry to write the first draft and paid him using private investor monies. Those monies were secured through a personal, family relationship, it is not a situation where a company or a bank or a studio will make waves regarding those monies. Everything is fully documented, we have all legal agreements, contracts and clear title for the book and screenplay through our company and the various entities that have developed the material.</p>
<p>As I also mentioned Terry Winter is represented at CAA (Creative Artists Agency). They will also be working with us once the financing entity is identified to package and distribute the film.</p>
<p>Right now we have the option of joining forces with a production company or working with private equity financing and bringing the movie fully financed to a studio for distribution who will also obviously physically make the film.</p>
<p>Bonnie has line producers she works with as far as budgeting the movie. We believe it will be under 25 million and can easily do that budget based on Terry&#8217;s draft, even though revisions will be made it will not change the shooting locations or dynamics of how the film will be produced and directed.</p>
<p>This is a character driven film set in the funeral business, art world and Hollywood where the main character encounters these worlds of façade in order to confront the demons in his own soul.</p>
<p>The main theme for the movie is &#8220;For what shall it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his soul&#8221;.</p>
<p>The renowned literary agent who sold the book Sterling Lord, Sterling represented Jack Kerouac, Mario Puzzo etc and sold the rights to The Godfather, Legend Of Bagger Vance, Goodfellas etc., said Framed is &#8216;The Raging Bull of the Art World&#8217;.</p>
<p>Frankly we believe its much more than that but you get my gist.</p>

      <div class="scrollbars excrt-cont re-994"><p><strong>The Movie<br />
</strong><br />
The film takes place in ‘the eternal city of spring’ of Medellin, Colombia and has scenes that travel<br />
through Colombia&#8217;s beautiful coastline like Cartagena and Santa Marta. Due to film incentives in<br />
Colombia we will be applying to get several incentives/tax credits of up to 30-40%.<br />
The film explores the realm of introspection, cognitive psychology and clairvoyant phenomena. It<br />
also explores the underworld of pigeon racing, crime, gambling and the social displacement of classes,<br />
race and creed, it has a strong emphasis on relationships, justice, romance, the metaphysical, and the<br />
human factor to fight for survival and maintain the preservation of the human spirit and of life.<br />
We take a unique story and visual experience in film and transform our characters into heroes, villains<br />
and muses. The main characters transcend through out their journey and encapsulate their own hope for<br />
freedom and liberty, a second chance at redemption and love. But it all comes at a very high price and<br />
only the strongest will survive.<br />
Our story is filled with amazing special visual effects that take place in lush tropical locations both<br />
in the city and on the pacific coast. The production of this highly stylized neo-noir psychological<br />
suspense thriller will have many breathtaking locations that will be contemporary and historic<br />
in style.<br />
The Audience<br />
Like all true romantic crime thrillers, the appeal of TDC is universal. Yet it also zeroes in on large<br />
audiences, sizeable enough to assure fiscal as well as artistic success of this movie.<br />
Across America, Latin America, Europe and Asia are well over one billion moviegoers with<br />
interest in thrillers with romantic and suspenseful overtones that involve the quest for freedom,<br />
romance, peace, equality and the hope for justice. This connects to the psychological and<br />
emotional values that play inside our minds and how we need to share and obtain them in order<br />
to grow as a society</p>

<div class="fild-st">The Payback Monies paid back to the investors and producers will come from the universal exploitation of the picture. Theatrical release, DVD’s, broadcast licenses, weekend special presentations, and soundtrack of the picture A brief description of the various markets or venues in which TDC may be exploited is as follows: (a) Movie Theatres. Theatrical distribution of motion pictures involving the manufacture of release prints from the original print, the promotion of a motion picture through advertising and publicity campaigns and the licensing and booking of the motion picture to theatrical exhibitors. Expenditures on these last mentioned activities are substantial and generally (but not always) have a direct relationship to the effect on revenues realized from the theatrical release of the motion picture. Motion pictures that are made available for a theatrical release are generally distributed by releasing agents and provide for a percentage of gross revenue to cover theatreoperating expenses with a split of rental payments thereafter between the distributor and the exhibitor. Under agreements with theatrical exhibitors, an exhibitor of the motion picture will pay license fees to the distributor on a percentage or flat rental basis. Under a percentage arrangement, the exhibitor will pay a percentage of box office receipts and under a flat rental arrangement; the exhibitor will pay a flat fee without regard to box office receipts. Generally, agreements for theatrical release of a motion picture provide for a larger percentage of box office receipts to be paid during the earlier weeks of distribution of the motion picture and a smaller percentage of box office receipts in later weeks. Such percentage to be paid to the distributor and the theatre exhibitor is determined by negotiation and generally varies between 10% to over 50% of the box office receipts. Many factors are involved in the negotiation of such percentages including the perceived potential success of the motion picture, the number of theatres being licensed and the location of the theatres; (b) Videocassette and videodisc. The videocassette and videodisc market areas have grown rapidly in recent years, especially for feature films, which have been exposed to theatrical exhibition. This market can, by itself, recoup all or a significant portion of the cost of production and distribution and even generates profit. The most significant aspect of this market is DVD and videocassette rentals for in-home viewing, a market, which continues to expand rapidly throughout North America (c) Pay-per-view television. The pay-per-view television delivery to private homes by cable television systems has been developing steadily in recent years and now represents a significant market for feature length films; d) Television. This market area is subdivided into three categories: free network television; pay and cable television markets; and syndicated television market, the most significant of which is the free network television market. Distribution agreements made with major free television networks in North America generally provide for a lump sum fee. In the United States, the pay and cable television markets have developed to a stage where the distributors offer license fees that are generally competitive with the free television network fees. Sales of theatrical motion pictures to pay and cable television networks in the United States and Canada are much more likely than sales to free television networks, although sales to both may occur. The television “syndication market” is comprised of a number of independent stations that have formed associations for the purpose of acquiring programming and may include some free network television stations. Motion pictures are generally only distributed in the syndication market after having completed stipulated license periods with pay television, cable television and/or free television networks. Revenues from this source can therefore be received for extended periods of time after a motion picture’s initial theatrical exhibition or other release; and (e) Sales of Sound Track. Films that achieve wide releases often market a compilation of the music used in the film and in some cases sales of digital and compact disks have and do generate significant additional revenue for the film. These are sold through conventional music vendors.</div>
