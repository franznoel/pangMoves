"The plugin will attempt to extract the critical CSS that is required to "
"format the page above the fold and put this in a <span class=\"notranslate"
"\">&lt;style&gt;</span> element inside the <span class=\"notranslate\">&lt;"
"head&gt;</span> section of the HTML to prevent 'render-blocking'. The "
"combined CSS will then be loaded asynchronously via javascript. Select the "
"number of HTML elements from the top of the page that you want the plugin to "
"find the critical CSS for. The smaller the number, the faster your site but "
"you might see some jumping of the page if the number is too small."
